# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project, I build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python language in Studio Visual Code. Two players, X and O will take turns in picking their next move
by entering the numbers in the command line. Any of those two players who successfully completed three consecutive identical marks (X or O) in a row, whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid, will be declared the game's winner.
