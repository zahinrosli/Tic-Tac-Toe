# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project, I build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python language in Studio Visual Code. Two players, X and O will take turns in picking their next move
by entering the numbers in the command line. The winner of this game will be determine after any of those two players completed three rows with their marks (X or O); whether vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
